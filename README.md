## Project Description

Northcoders News has articles which are divided into topics, and each article has user-curated ratings from upvotes and downvotes using an API.
Users can view a list of all articles, or a list of selected articles by topics, also view a list of comments associated with an article.

The application also allows users to view an individual article, like it or dislike it, post a new comment to an existing article and delete their own comment/s. Users are not allow to delete other user's comments. In case there is an error, from the api or the client side, the users are informed with an error message. The application includes darkmode, mobile navigation and is fully responsive

The technologies I used to build this project includes React, Express, PSQL, Node, Css, Tailwind CSS.


In the future I hope to be able to implement user authentication to make the application complete.
